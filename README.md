<p>Repository for potential Home Assistant (HA) work.</p>
<p>Currently use Google Home and enjoy the simplicty and reliability of it; however as many others have noted, it has its limitations. As an engineer working in the industrial automation field, it was a matter of time until part of that automation magic was carried over into my home.</p>
<p>Have previously dabbled in both HA and Homebridge, but recently decided to go all in with HA.</p>
